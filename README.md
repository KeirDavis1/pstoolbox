# PS Toolbox

Making Powershell tools simpler and easier to find

## How to use

PS1 files in the tools folder will be listed in the toolbox listing on application start.

PS1 files in the functions folder will not be listed by callable by the tools in the toolbox.

Tools & functions can be put into sub-directories to categorise them as you see fit. It does
a recursive include on the tools & functions.

## Additions

Please feel free to add any generic functions or tools that may be useful to the public.
